%return the distribution of the cells at birth and death, estimated by
%assuming that the leaves are in the absorbing state


% MODE Sspecifies how the prob is evaluated: 
% MODE = 0 -> at leaves, it just propagates backwards the delta peak
% MODE = 1 -> it uses the FPT at leaves
% MODE = 2 -> we dont exactly know where it turned on, because the
%             timepoints before the anotated onset are just not quantified
%             therefore we have to integrate over all timepoint in the
%             leaves from between the insptected timepoint in the beginning
%             to the insptectd tps in the end
